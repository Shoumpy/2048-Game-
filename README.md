# 2048-Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the popular game, 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and the goal is to merge tiles with the same number to create a tile with a higher number, eventually reaching the elusive 2048 tile.

# How to Play
The game is played using the arrow keys on the keyboard to move tiles in the corresponding direction. When two tiles with the same number are adjacent, they merge into a tile with double the number. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created, and the game is lost when there are no possible moves left on the board.
